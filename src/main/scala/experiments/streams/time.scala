   * events using a key function E => K, The state keeps all matching events received during the interval.
   * If a new matching event for which the predicate no longer holds is received the cached events are removed and
   * no result is pushed. If a matching events is received at or after the duration the entire sequence of cached
   * events is passed to a reduce function and the result is pushed downstream.
   *
   * @param duration    filter for this amount of time
   * @param predicate   predicate that has to hold for the entire duration
   * @param key         E=>K maps events to a key by which they are cached
